# Party-Progressive-Budget
# About the project:
This is party progressive budget. This is a web application that allows the users to track their expenses through subraction and adding. They can create a Transation 
without trouble. When the user enters the transaction while offline, all data is stored in IndexedDB and transferred back to the database.

# User's Story
I need an system to track my budget expenses for a special occassion, like travel and partying. 
When I create my own transaction, I am able to make deposits or withdrawals of my account.

# Motivation

My motivation is to make a transaction and its buttons is working smoothly and properly. Another motivation is to make 
functionality and space for the code to work. As a web developer, I want the website to run on its own.
